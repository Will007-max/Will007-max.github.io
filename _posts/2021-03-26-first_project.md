Here are some words about how I wrote and organized my first project.

# I. Context

Completing my data science bootcamp, I wanted to realize a great interesting project allowing me to develop new skills and deeply apply the majort part of what I learned. And, for me, what could be better than Deep Learning ?

Based on my knowledge on some possible machine learning applications around us, in my project I wanted to analyze video streaming in order to detect and predict emotions. It could be interesting for many applications like security cameras, job interviews, improving the quality of customer service...

Because emotions may be expressed on faces and via voice tones, a priori, this can be done by simultaneously processing video streaming, audio and (transcripted) text.
