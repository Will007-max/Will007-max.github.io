Here are some words about how I wrote and organized my first project.

# I. Context

Completing my data science bootcamp, I wanted to realize a great interesting project allowing me to develop new skills and deeply apply the majort part of what I learned. And, for me, what could be better than Deep Learning ? Based on my knowledge on some possible machine learning applications around us, in my project I wanted to analyze video streaming in order to detect and predict emotions. It could be interesting for many applications like security cameras, job interviews, improving the quality of customer service...

Because emotions may be expressed on faces and via voice tones, a priori, this can be done by simultaneously processing video streaming, audio and (transcripted) text. I was wondering if this sort of project could be achieved in the time we had (less than a month). Basically, I have a good scientific backbroung, and I can quickly learn a lot of things. But, I didn't know if it was enough since I never managed this kind of project, in addition it was not my main scientific topic (so, many things to learn from scratch).

I was even wondering where to find data to feed to my machine learning algorithms, and how to train them ? I meant what kind of models could be applied in order to have great performances. In addition, could I locally train my models ? or I must use cloud infrastructures and online notebooks and frameworks ? Another point was to getting started and to learn the main concepts to master and manage my project. On of my supervisor suggests to me to simply start with audio and text processing since I might be quite tricky with the three channels.
