The purpose of this project is to learn to recognize *detected* faces.
First of all, it is a question of detecting the faces (answer the question how to
detect a face), and then, in a second step, it is a question of recognizing the
detected faces (for instance answer the question who is the person in the image).
The applications of face recognition are present in the current life: to unlock mobile phones (for instance Face ID present since the iPhone X), or even in China to control citizens.
