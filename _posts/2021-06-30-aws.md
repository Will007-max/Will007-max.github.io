## 1. Introduction

AWS standing for *Amazon web services* is just an ensemble of services.
These services are available in the Cloud with a very fast deployment. In the
Cloud, it is the on-demand service with *Pay-As-You-Go pricing* unlike on-premise
where there is generally under- or over-consumption of available resources.
Amazon like other Cloud providers delivers different kind of services that you
can choose according to your needs: virtual machines (IaaS), storage, network,
computing, to just mention a few. In the following, I present some use cases of
AWS that I implemented after a training in system administration, network and cloud.

## 2. Getting started with AWS

AWS consolidates an ensemble of data centers in different physical locations across
several regions of the world. In order to experiment with AWS resources, you need to
create an AWS account as shown in the following figure, and then follow the steps.

After created your account and/or when wanting use AWS, it is asked to connect to
the AWS management console, it is just the web interface that allow to use Amazon Web Services. You might end up with something like in the following figure. In my case, I created a simple account and use the free resources, the default region is Ohio
in USA but it is possible to change it.

As you can see, AWS has many available services. In the following, I will present
some use cases I implemented on AWS.


## 2. Linux virtual machine (Amazon EC2)

Cloud computing and virtualization are two closely related concepts. EC2 standing
for *Elastic computing* is the virtual machine service of AWS, it allows for
instance to launch servers, administrate them, and even install anything you want in
the case of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).


## 3. Windows virtual machine (Amazon EC2)

## 4. Storage (Amazon S3)

## 5. Web development environment (MySQL, Apache, PHP and PHPMyAdmin)

### 5.1. MySQL database (Amazon RDS)

### 5.2. A virtual machine to install Linux, Apache and PHPMyAdmin (Amazon EC2)

## 6. AWS CLI

## 7. Other AWS operations

### 7.1. Networking with Virtual Private Cloud

### 7.2. Monitoring Infrastructure with CloudWatch

### 7.3. Configuration Management with CloudFormation

### 7.4. Scalable Deployment Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

### 7.5. Auto-scaling
