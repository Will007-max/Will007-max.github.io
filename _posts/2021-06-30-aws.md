## 1. Introduction

AWS standing for *Amazon web services* is just an ensemble of services.
These services are available in the Cloud with a very fast deployment. In the
Cloud, it is the on-demand service with *Pay-As-You-Go pricing* unlike on-premise
where there is generally under- or over-consumption of available resources.
Amazon like other Cloud providers delivers different kind of services that you
can choose according to your needs: virtual machines (IaaS), storage, network,
computing, to just mention a few. In the following, I present some use cases of
AWS that I implemented after a training in system administration, network and cloud.

## 2. Getting started with AWS

AWS consolidates an ensemble of data centers in different physical locations across
several regions of the world. In order to experiment with AWS resources, you need to
create an AWS account as shown in the following figure, and then follow the steps.

After created your account and/or when wanting use AWS, it is asked to connect to
the AWS management console, it is just the web interface that allow to use Amazon Web Services. You might end up with something like in the following figure. In my case, I created a simple account and use the free resources, the default region is Ohio
in USA but it is possible to change it.

As you can see, AWS has many available services. In the following, I will present
some use cases I implemented on AWS.


## 2. Linux virtual machine (Amazon EC2)

Cloud computing and virtualization are two closely related concepts. EC2 standing
for *Elastic computing* is the virtual machine service of AWS, it allows for
instance to launch servers, administrate them, and even install anything you want in
the case of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Once connected on the Amazon console, we can have a look at the several available
services. To create a virtual machine, EC2 has to be chosen and an Amazon EC2
instance has to be launched, as indicated on the following figure.

The Amazon EC2 instance is the virtual server in the cloud. Once clicked on **Launch instance**, the first step is to choose the AMI image (Amazon machine image) our
server is going to execute, what operating system (OS).

Several of these images are released and updated by Amazon, other images are in
the AWS marketplace, as you can see on the previous figure. For a Linux virtual
machine, I simply selected the first one: *Amazon Linux 2 AMI*.

As a second step, the instance type has to be chosen, it is the instance size,
the amount of CPU, GPU, RAM, storage... suited to our use case. Several families
are available. For my free usage, I choosed *t2_micro* as suggested.

Then, we must configure the instance details: the number of instances, the virtual
network containing the instance and our other needed resources. I choosed to launch
only one instance, and I choosed the default virtual private cloud (VPC) suggested
by AWS. I also choosed the default parameters for storage (it is 8 GB for the
chosen instance) and I didn't add any taggs.

Before the last step, I configured the security group, it is possible to create
a new one or just use an existing security group: it is just the firewal rules,
allow connexions (SSH, HTTP,...) from users (IP addresses) through ports (22, 80).
You may even give a name to the security group. As you can see on the following
figure, I added two rules: to allow SSH on port 22 only from my IP address, and
another rule to authorize any user to access to a web server that can be installed
on this instance.
