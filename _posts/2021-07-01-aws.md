## 1. Introduction

AWS standing for *Amazon web services* is just an ensemble of services.
These services are available in the Cloud with a very fast deployment. In the
Cloud, it is the on-demand service with *Pay-As-You-Go pricing* unlike on-premise
where there is generally under- or over-consumption of available resources.
Amazon like other Cloud providers delivers different kind of services that you
can choose according to your needs: virtual machines (IaaS), storage, network,
computing, to just mention a few. In the following, I present some use cases of
AWS that I implemented after a training in system administration, network and cloud.

## 2. Getting started with AWS

AWS consolidates an ensemble of data centers in different physical locations across
several regions of the world. In order to experiment with AWS resources, you need to
create an AWS account as shown in the following figure, and then follow the steps.

After created your account and/or when wanting use AWS, it is asked to connect to
the AWS management console, it is just the web interface that allow to use Amazon Web Services. You might end up with something like in the following figure. In my case, I created a simple account and use the free resources, the default region is Ohio
in USA but it is possible to change it.

As you can see, AWS has many available services. In the following, I will present
some use cases I implemented on AWS.


## 3. Linux virtual machine (Amazon EC2)

Cloud computing and virtualization are two closely related concepts. EC2 standing
for *Elastic computing* is the virtual machine service of AWS, it allows for
instance to launch servers, administrate them, and even install anything you want in
the case of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Once connected on the Amazon console, we can have a look at the several available
services. To create a virtual machine, EC2 has to be chosen and an Amazon EC2
instance has to be launched, as indicated on the following figure.   

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_launch.jpg#center)

The Amazon EC2 instance is the virtual server in the cloud. Once clicked on **Launch instance**, the first step is to choose the AMI image (Amazon machine image) our
server is going to execute, what operating system (OS).

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_linux_AMI.jpg#center)

Several of these images are released and updated by Amazon, other images are in
the AWS marketplace, as you can see on the previous figure. For a Linux virtual
machine, I simply selected the first one: *Amazon Linux 2 AMI*.

As a second step, the instance type has to be chosen, it is the instance size,
the amount of CPU, GPU, RAM, storage... suited to our use case. Several families
are available. For my free usage, I choosed *t2_micro* as suggested.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_linux_t2micro.jpg#center)

Then, we must configure the instance details: the number of instances, the virtual
network containing the instance and our other needed resources. I choosed to launch
only one instance, and I choosed the default virtual private cloud (VPC) suggested
by AWS. I also choosed the default parameters for storage (it is 8 GB for the
chosen instance) and I didn't add any taggs.

Before the last step, I configured the security group, it is possible to create
a new one or just use an existing security group: it is just the firewal rules,
allow connexions (SSH, HTTP,...) from users (IP addresses) through ports
(22, 80,...).You may even give a name to the security group. As you can see on the following figure, I added two rules: to allow SSH on port 22 only from my IP
address, and another rule to authorize any user to access to a web server that
can be installed on this instance.

It is useful and secure to assign a SSH key pair in order to connect to the
remote server, so I created and download a new SSH key pair, as shown in the
following figure.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_linux_key_launch.jpg#center)

After launching the instance, it is available in less one minute. You can see it
is running, a lot of informations about the instance: its type, the attached SSH
key pair, its security group, its public IP address and domain name... It is now
possible to remotely connect to the server via SSH and the key pair. In the
following, it is what I type on my terminal.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_linux_ssh.png#center)

As the instance can now be remotely controlled, as a system administrator or even
as a simple user, I can type different commands to manage disks, users, install applications.

## 4. Windows virtual machine (Amazon EC2)

Here, the purpose has been to create a Windows virtual machine on AWS and to have
access to its desktop from a remote workstation. It is different from what I did
with Linux where the remote control was via SSH and only using the terminal.

Like with Linux, I choosed an Amazon machine image and I follow the same steps,
here it is a Windows server 2019 image. I had to specify the rules in the security
group in order to allow the desktop remote control. And for this purpose, I used
RDP protocol of TCP with port 3389 which is suited for that, as illustrated in the following figure.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_windows_inbound_rules.jpg#center)

Once launched the Windows instance on AWS, I used a RDP client to connect it from
a remote desktop. As indicated in the following figure, I have entered the DNS
address or the IP address of the instance, and I created a password to enable remote access. It is also possible to download the remote desktop file and directly
enter the user name and password related to the instance.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_windows_remote_client.jpg#center)

Once completed, there is a confirmation message indicating the remote connection
and you need to approve to enable the remote desktop control. After about 3 seconds,
the remote desktop appears to the screen of the local machine (as shown in the
  following figure), you may use Windows, configure and install what you want.

## 5. Storage (Amazon S3)

Amazon S3 is a service used by many companies and it enables storage of files. For
instance, it is possible to host static websites on Amazon S3, store images and
videos, archives, save application states (logs). It is part of what is called
*object storage*.

The goal here has been to create storage spaces via S3, how to use the S3 service,
how to use an image already stored in the Cloud.

It started by connecting on the AWS Management Console, and I choosed S3 in the
**Storage** group, then I had this page (see the following figure) suggesting to
create a bucket. The **bucket** can be seen as a container to store the **objects**
representing our files and images. For information, on S3, objects have a size
limit (of about 160 GB), there can be a maximum of 100 buckets per AWS account,
however each bucket can contain as many objects as desired and thus allow to
store a "virtually" unlimited amount of data. Amazon S3 provides APIs to manage
all these resources.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_storage_s3_bucket.png#center)

As you can see in the following figure, I created a bucket and inside I uploaded some files. In AWS S3, each uploaded file has an URL enabling its access from a navigator but  before you have to make public both the bucket (containing the file) and the file so that
you don't get a denied access.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_storage_s3_bucket.png#center)

The created and uploaded file are from a small HTML page. In <img> HTML tags, I
put the corresponding URL from S3 as values of the "src" attributes, and as you
can see in the next figure the web page is well displayed with everything that is
stored in AWS S3 bucket.
