Here are a couple of projects I have done with AWS when I first started. I outline
the steps that allowed me to complete the projects, and I put special emphasis on detailing the relevant AWS concepts that are involved in these projects.

## 1. Introduction

AWS standing for *Amazon web services* is just an ensemble of services.
These services are available in the Cloud with a very fast deployment. In the
Cloud, it is the on-demand service with *Pay-As-You-Go pricing* unlike on-premise
where there is generally under- or over-consumption of available resources.
Amazon like other Cloud providers delivers different kind of services that you
can choose according to your needs: virtual machines (IaaS), storage, network,
computing, to just mention a few. In the following, I present some use cases of
AWS that I implemented after a training in system administration, network and cloud.

## 2. Getting started with AWS

AWS consolidates an ensemble of data centers in different physical locations across
several regions of the world. In order to experiment with AWS resources, you need to
create an AWS account as shown in the following figure, and then follow the steps.

After created your account and/or when wanting use AWS, it is asked to connect to
the AWS management console, it is just the web interface that allows to use Amazon Web Services. You might end up with something like in the following figure. In my case, I created a simple account and use the free resources, the default region is Ohio
in USA but it is possible to change it.

As you can see, AWS has many available services. In the following, I will present
some use cases I implemented on AWS.


## 3. Linux virtual machine (Amazon EC2)

Cloud computing and virtualization are two closely related concepts. EC2 standing
for *Elastic Compute Cloud* is the virtual machine service of AWS, it allows for
instance to launch servers, administrate them, and even install anything you want in
the case of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Once connected on the Amazon console, we can have a look at the several available
services. To create a virtual machine, EC2 has to be chosen and an Amazon EC2
instance has to be launched, as indicated on the following figure.   

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_launch.jpg#center)

The Amazon EC2 instance is the virtual server in the cloud. Once clicked on **Launch instance**, the first step is to choose the AMI image (Amazon machine image) our
server is going to execute, what operating system (OS).

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_linux_AMI.jpg#center)

Several of these images are released and updated by Amazon, other images are in
the AWS marketplace, as you can see on the previous figure. For a Linux virtual
machine, I simply selected the first one: *Amazon Linux 2 AMI*.

As a second step, the instance type has to be chosen, it is the instance size,
the amount of CPU, GPU, RAM, storage... suited to our use case. Several families
are available. For my free usage, I choosed *t2_micro* as suggested.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_linux_t2micro.jpg#center)

Then, we must configure the instance details: the number of instances, the virtual
network containing the instance and our other needed resources. I choosed to launch
only one instance, and I choosed the default virtual private cloud (VPC) suggested
by AWS. I also choosed the default parameters for storage (it is 8 GB for the
chosen instance) and I didn't add any taggs.

Before the last step, I configured the security group, it is possible to create
a new one or just use an existing security group: it is just the firewal rules,
allow connexions (SSH, HTTP,...) from users (IP addresses) through ports
(22, 80,...).You may even give a name to the security group. As you can see on the following figure, I added two rules: to allow SSH on port 22 only from my IP
address, and another rule to authorize any user to access to a web server that
can be installed on this instance.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_linux_security_group.jpg#center)

It is useful and secure to assign a SSH key pair in order to connect to the
remote server, so I created and download a new SSH key pair, as shown in the
following figure.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_linux_key_launch.jpg#center)

After launching the instance, it is available in less one minute. You can see it
is running, a lot of informations about the instance: its type, the attached SSH
key pair, its security group, its public IP address and domain name... It is now
possible to remotely connect to the server via SSH and the key pair. In the
following, it is what I type on my terminal.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_linux_ssh.png#center)

As the instance can now be remotely controlled, as a system administrator or even
as a simple user, I can type different commands to manage disks, users, install applications.

## 4. Windows virtual machine (Amazon EC2)

Here, the purpose has been to create a Windows virtual machine on AWS and to have
access to its desktop from a remote workstation. It is different from what I did
with Linux where the remote control was via SSH and only using the terminal.

Like with Linux, I choosed an Amazon machine image and I follow the same steps,
here it is a Windows server 2019 image. I had to specify the rules in the security
group in order to allow the desktop remote control. And for this purpose, I used
RDP protocol of TCP with port 3389 which is suited for that, as illustrated in the following figure.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_windows_inbound_rules.jpg#center)

Once launched the Windows instance on AWS, I used a RDP client to connect it from
a remote desktop. As indicated in the following figure, I have entered the DNS
address or the IP address of the instance both available on AWS, and I created a
password to enable remote access. It is also possible to download the remote
desktop file and directly enter the user name and password related to the instance.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_ec2_windows_remote_client.jpg#center)

Once completed, there is a confirmation message indicating the remote connection
and you need to approve to enable the remote desktop control. After about 3 seconds,
the remote desktop appears to the screen of the local machine (as shown in the
following figure), you may use Windows, configure and install what you want.

## 5. Storage (Amazon S3)

Amazon S3 (standing for *Simple Storage Service*) is a service used by many
companies and it enables storage of files. For instance, it is possible to host
static websites on Amazon S3, store images and videos, archives, save application
states (logs). It is part of what is called *object storage*.

The goal here has been to create storage spaces via S3, know how to use the S3
service, how to use an image already stored in the Cloud.

It started by connecting on the AWS Management Console, and I choosed S3 in the
**Storage** group, then I had this page (see the following figure) suggesting to
create a bucket. The **bucket** can be seen as a container to store the **objects**
representing our files and images. For information, on S3, objects have a size
limit (of about 160 GB), there can be a maximum of 100 buckets per AWS account,
however each bucket can contain as many objects as desired and thus allows to
store a "virtually" unlimited amount of data. One constraint is the unicity of the
bucket name over Internet since it appears on the files URLs. Amazon S3 provides
APIs to manage all these resources.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_storage_s3_bucket.png#center)

As you can see in the following figure, I created a bucket and inside I uploaded some files. In AWS S3, each uploaded file has an URL enabling its access from a browser but  before, you have to make public both the bucket (containing the file) and the file so that
you don't get a (by default) denied access.

![Image](/assets/images/aws_s3_bucket_files.jpg#center)

The created and uploaded files are from a small HTML page. In "img" HTML tags, I
put the corresponding URL from S3 as values of the "src" attributes, and as you
can see in the next figure the web page is well displayed with everything that is
stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

## 6. Web development environment (MySQL, Apache, PHP and PHPMyAdmin)

In order to install all the features of an efficient web server, there are four
main elements that are essential to build a website server:

- Here *Linux* represents the operating system, and it manages the available resources
- The *Apache* web server handles user requests
- MySQL acts as a database server to manage the various data
- PHP here is the programming language used to create dynamic web pages. Indeed,
it is needed to have a binary that can execute PHP code, much like Python or Java.

### 6.1. MySQL database (Amazon RDS)

Amazon RDS standing for *Relational Database Service* is an AWS service allowing to
create an environment to execute an instance of a relational database. It is also
possible to use EC2 and install a server like MySQL but RDS makes life easier
using a preconfigured ready-to-use server.

In the following, I report how to run an RDS server in the AWS cloud.

I have chosen the RDS service present in the *Database* group and, to launch an
instance, I clicked on **Create database**, then I choosed MySQL as a database
management system because it is free. While creating the instance, I have
customized the server: several settings like instance name (corresponding to the
database server that may contain several databases), master username and
password, to indicate in which VPC the server is located, to choose or not the
(public) accessibility to the server, to choose the database name... Creating and
launching a new instance may take several minutes. When the server has started,
**Available** is indicated as status. As shown in the following figure, more details
of the instance are indicated, and in particular the *endpoint* which is the DNS
address of the server.

### 6.2. A virtual machine to install Linux (Amazon EC2), Apache and PHPMyAdmin

After instancing a virtual machine using Linux as operating system (as shown in
a previous section), to install a web site server, different command lines are
required to be entered :

```js
sudo apt install apache2 php mysql-server libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```

***libapache2-mod-php*** is a PHP library enabling Apache web server to interpret
and handle PHP code so that Apache can sent rendered web pages to the clients
rather than PHP code.

***php-mysql*** package provides MySQL modules for PHP, to enable association and
communication between PHP and MySQL database server.
