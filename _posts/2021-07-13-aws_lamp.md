In order to install all the features of an efficient web server, there are four
main elements that are essential to build a website server:

- Here *Linux* represents the operating system, and it manages the available resources
- The *Apache* web server handles user requests
- MySQL acts as a database server to manage the various data
- PHP here is the programming language used to create dynamic web pages. Indeed,
it is needed to have a binary that can execute PHP code, much like Python or Java.

## 1. MySQL database (Amazon RDS)

Amazon RDS standing for *Relational Database Service* is an AWS service allowing to
create an environment to execute an instance of a relational database. It is also
possible to use EC2 and install a server like MySQL but RDS makes life easier
using a preconfigured ready-to-use server.

In the following, I report how to run a RDS server in the AWS cloud.

I have chosen the RDS service present in the *Database* group and, to launch an
instance, I clicked on **Create database**, then I choosed MySQL as a database
management system because it is free. While creating the instance, I have
customized the server: several settings like instance name (corresponding to the
database server that may contain several databases), master username and
password, to indicate in which VPC the server is located, to choose or not the
(public) accessibility to the server, to choose the database name... Creating and
launching a new instance may take several minutes. When the server has started,
**Available** is indicated as status. As shown in the following figure, more details
of the instance are indicated, and in particular the *endpoint* which is the DNS
address of the server.

Special emphasis should be given to the security group that should allow access and connection to the database server. In what I did, I opened all ports and gave access to any IP address, this is not great in terms of security but it allows me to test what I want without being blocked.

## 2. A virtual machine to install Linux (Amazon EC2), Apache and phpMyAdmin

After instancing a virtual machine using Linux as operating system (as shown in
a previous section), to install a web site server, there are several steps :

- Update software packages

```js
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
- Install Apache web server

```js
sudo apt install apache2 apache2-utils
```

***apache2-utils*** installs some useful utilities

- Install MySQL

```js
sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client
```

***mysql-client*** package allows you to connect to a MySQL server. It will give
you the "mysql" command-line program.

***mysql-server*** package allows to run a MySQL server which can host multiple
databases and process queries on those databases.

- Install PHP

```js
sudo apt install php7.4 libapache2-mod-php7.4 php7.4-mysql php-common php7.4-cli
```
***libapache2-mod-php*** is a PHP library enabling Apache web server to interpret
and handle PHP code so that Apache can sent rendered web pages to the clients
rather than PHP code.

***php-mysql*** package provides MySQL modules for PHP, to enable association and
communication between PHP and MySQL database server.

***php-common*** package contains common utilities shared among all packaged PHP
versions.

***php-cli*** package enables to execute PHP files using command line interface

In the following figure, is represented the default page of Apache 2 when the
public DNS address of the server is entered in the browser.

- Install phpMyAdmin

***phpMyAdmin*** is a tool that allows us to access and manage our database very easily,
because the operations are done in graphical mode rather than with the mysql console.

I describe how to install and use *phpMyAdmin* from the Linux server.

```js
sudo apt update
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
```
By typing the previous commands on the terminal of the Linux server, you install
and configure *phpMyAdmin*, there are several steps of validation. When it is
installed, you have to set up the configuration file in order to have access to
the remote database.

In the file **/etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php**, I added the DNS address of the remote
database, as indicated in the following figure.

When done, I launched *phpMyAdmin* using the DNS address of the Linux server, and
as shown in the following figure, I fill in the user and the access password.

As shown in the following figure, it is now possible to remotely manage the AWS database server using phpMyAdmin.

Hence, we have a Linux server hosted in the AWS cloud and integrating PHP, a database server managed via phpMyAdmin through a web interface accessible from the first server: this is a web development environment enabling the creation of dynamic web pages.
