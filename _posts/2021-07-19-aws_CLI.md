AWS CLI standing for *Command Line Interface* is a simple utility that allows you
to access AWS services via the command line. It is located between the user and
AWS to access and use the different services from our computer.

It allows you to do many more things than the AWS management console, and allows
for instance to automate operations such as file copies, virtual machine creations, maintenance and network operations, AWS services and APIs, to just name a few.

## 1. Installation

The command line is written in Python, so the only requirement is to have Python
installed on your machine. It works well on Windows, Linux or MacOS; I used MacOS
and Python is already installed, so I just typed:

```js
pip3 install awscli
```

In order to not directly use my AWS root account for my manipulations, I started by
creating an IAM user (Identity and Access Management) using the Amazon management
console, and I gave to this user the same rights as an administrator. I also
choosed as access type both programmatic access (to have an access key ID and
secret access key) and AWS management console access.

## 2. Configuration

It is very simple to configure AWS CLI from the terminal, you just need to type
the following command:

```js
aws configure
```

And, as shown on the following figure, 4 parameters needed to be entered.

## 3. Some commands 

To use the CLI, it will always take about the same form: specifying the aws executable, the service (ec2, s3...), the function of the service you want to use (describe-instances...), the parameters, options to explore the CLI response.

```js
aws <service> <function> --parameters --option
```

- Create a key pair, used for accessing instances

It is simple to create a key pair just by using the following command on a CLI
terminal:

```js
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name cliKeyAws --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > cliKeyAws.pem
```

The option *--key-name* is the key pair name and it is mandatory to have a name,
so this option is required.

*--query 'KeyMaterial'* is just an option for restricting the output of the
command to the actual contents of the private key, without any other data like the
fingerprint or the key ID.

As with the creation using AWS management console, the private key is not stored
in AWS but in a computer, here in the corresponding repository; the fingerprint
and the key pair ID are stored in AWS.

- Create a security group

A security group is like a firewall for a VPC standing for virtual private cloud.
You can create it by typing the following command:

```js
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name cli-secu-group --description "created using CLI" --vpc-id vpc-1b9ffa70
```
where here *vpc-1b9ffa70* is the ID of my default VPC.

As by default all inbound traffic is forbidden, it is good to add new inbound roles to
allow traffic. I like to allow SSH connexion from my computer, and HTTP and HTTPS
connexion from any other computer, so I type the following commands:

```js
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-02e16e366db1862c1 --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 176.160.140.146/32
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-02e16e366db1862c1 --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-02e16e366db1862c1 --protocol tcp --port 443 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```
- An Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume for an AWS instance

EBS volume is just like an additional storage that can be attached to an AWS
instance.

I started by creating a volume using ***Elastic Block Store*** in EC2 service.
You subsequently click on *Volumes*, then **Create Volume** and then, on the
page that is opened you have to choose its characteristics (type, size... and the availability zone), then click on **Create Volume** at the bottom of the page.
It is all ! But it is simpler using the AWS CLI, you just have to type the following command:

```js
aws ec2 create-volume --volume-type gp2 --availability-zone us-east-2b --size 8
```

- Create an EC2 instance

- Shutting down one or more instances
