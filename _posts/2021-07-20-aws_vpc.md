When an account is created on AWS, the base unit is the VPC which is available
on a specific **region** on AWS while a subnet of a VPC is located in an
**availability zone**.

Internet Gateway (IGW) and Virtual private Gateway (VPG) respectively enable our
VPC to connect to Internet or another VPC.

Routers allow to route packets either internally between private networks or to
the outside world by IGW or VPG, and all this is managed with **routing tables**.
