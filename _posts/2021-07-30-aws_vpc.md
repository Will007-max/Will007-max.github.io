Here it is about VPC standing for Virtual Private Cloud. It is the service that allows
you to isolate a section of the whole AWS network and make it your own virtual private
network. In this network, you are the administrator and you can configure it as you
desire, choose your IP address range, choose your segmentation into subnets,
choose the kind of traffic filters you want to use... The resources you are going
to launch or the databases are going to run in this VPC, and are going to use the pre-defined IP address ranges and the routing rules defined within this VPC. This VPC
network can even be connected to an on-premise network in a datacenter for instance,
either through a VPN gateway or through a more advanced service called *Direct connect*.


## 1. Introduction

When an account is created on AWS, the base unit is the VPC standing for
**virtual private cloud**. VPC is a private network which is available on a
specific **region** on AWS while a **subnet** of a VPC is located in an
**availability zone**.

To connect our VPC to Internet or another VPC, **Internet Gateway** (IGW) and
**Virtual private Gateway** (VPG) respectively are two essential elements needing
to be used.

Routers allow to route packets either internally between private networks or to
the outside world by IGW or VPG, and all this is managed with **routing tables**.

To manage the traffic, security is needed to authorize or not the different
transfers. To do this, there is a first layer of security specific to the network
called **Network Access Control List** (Network ACL), which is a firewall that will,
for instance, accept incoming traffic on a particular port to a subnet and not
another one. To complete this security at the network level, there is another
level of security which are the **security groups** (SG) at the AWS instances
level.
