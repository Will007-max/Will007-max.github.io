<p>
Welcome to my blog. My name is William, I am Data scientist and Machine Learning Engineer.
</p>

<p>
With a strong scientific background, I learned a lot about algorithms and programming. For instance, I taught Python courses for two years to double degree students at the Orsay faculty of sciences, they were more focused on numerical methods to solve science problems, scientific computing, data analysis.
</p>

<p>
I also completed many MOOC on R and Python languages, data science and machine learning, which enhanced my knowledge in mathematics, probability and statistics, and allowed me to understand and implement the related algorithms (many "from scratch") and to practice on different cases encountered.
