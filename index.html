<p>
Welcome to my blog. I am William, scientist and data scientist.
</p>

<p>
With a strong scientific background, I learned a lot about algorithms and
programming. For instance, I taught Python courses for two years to double
degree students at the Orsay faculty of sciences, they were more focused on
numerical methods to solve science problems, scientific computing, data analysis.
</p>

<p>
I also completed many MOOC on R and Python languages, data science and machine
learning, which enhanced my knowledge in mathematics, probability and
statistics, and allowed me to understand and implement the related algorithms
(many "from scratch") and to practice on different cases encountered.
</p>

<p>
Since MOOCs can usually only focus on machine learning algorithms and their
understanding, I decided to complete a full stack data science bootcamp. It
covered most of the concepts that are involved in this ecosystem: data
collection, data analysis, data visualization, data engineering, supervized
and unsupervised machine learning, deep learning.
</p>
